<h1 align="center">Noice: Natural Calming Noise</h1>

For a lot of people, a little background noise is helpful to calm down and
focus. In some cases, it's also a boost to productivity. Background noise can
also help minimize the effects of stress.

Noice is an app that allows you to create your own set of background sounds by
mixing clips from environmental sources. Create your perfect surroundings by
combining different sounds to drown out distractions so you can focus on your
work, or generate serene peaceful environments that encourage you to fall
asleep.
