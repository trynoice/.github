# Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds and sizes. This includes everything from
simple bug reports to large features.

## Guiding Principles

- We allow anyone to participate in our projects. Tasks can be carried out by anyone
  that demonstrates the capability to complete them
- Always be respectful of one another. Assume the best in others and act with empathy
  at all times
- Collaborate closely with individuals maintaining the project or experienced users.
  Getting ideas out in the open and seeing a proposal before it's a pull request helps
  reduce redundancy and ensures we're all connected to the decision-making process

## Workflow

- We love GitHub issues!
- For small feature requests, an issue first proposing it for discussion or demo
  implementation in a PR suffice.
- For big feature requests, please open an issue to avoid wasting time on a
  feature that might need reworking.
- Small pull requests for things like typos, bug fixes, etc are always welcome.

## Best Practices

- Use recommended tools for each sub-projects.
- Let your code editor or IDE do the code formatting.
- Add comments wherever you deem them necessary.
- Include tests when adding new features.
- When fixing bugs, please consider starting with a test-case that highlights
  how the current behaviour is broken.
- Whenever in doubt, please reach out and seek clarification.
